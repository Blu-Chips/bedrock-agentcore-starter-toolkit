# Requirements Document - Stress Testing Framework

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive stress-testing framework for the AWS Bedrock AI Agent Fraud Detection System. The system currently has 4 specialized agents, 1 orchestrator, and a reasoning engine processing transactions through AWS infrastructure (Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB). The stress-testing framework will validate system performance, scalability, reliability, and failure recovery under extreme load conditions across all deployment environments (dev, staging, production).

## Requirements

5. IF Bedrock API experiences throttling THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry with backoff strategy

### Requirement 6: External Tool Integration Stress Testing

5. IF all external tools fail simultaneously THEN the system SHALL operate in degraded mode using internal heuristics

### Requirement 7: Failure Recovery and Resilience Testing
