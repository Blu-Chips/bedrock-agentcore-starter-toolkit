# AWS AI Agent Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements to enhance the existing fraud detection system to fully meet AWS-defined AI agent qualifications. The system currently has rule-based detection and basic AI analysis, but needs enhanced reasoning capabilities, autonomous decision-making, and better integration with AWS services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced AI Reasoning and Decision-Making

**User Story:** As a fraud detection system, I want to use advanced LLM reasoning to analyze complex transaction patterns and make autonomous decisions, so that I can detect sophisticated fraud schemes that rule-based systems miss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is received THEN the system SHALL use Claude LLM to perform multi-step reasoning analysis
2. WHEN analyzing transactions THEN the system SHALL consider historical patterns, user behavior, and contextual factors
3. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reasoning explanations for each decision
4. WHEN confidence is low THEN the system SHALL request additional data or escalate to human review
5. IF transaction patterns are complex THEN the system SHALL break down analysis into logical steps
6. WHEN new fraud patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL adapt its reasoning approach autonomously

### Requirement 2: Autonomous Agent Capabilities

**User Story:** As a bank operations manager, I want the fraud detection agent to operate autonomously with minimal human intervention, so that I can process high transaction volumes efficiently while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions arrive THEN the system SHALL process them automatically without human input
2. WHEN fraud is detected THEN the system SHALL take appropriate actions (block, flag, alert) autonomously
3. WHEN system confidence is high THEN decisions SHALL be executed without human approval
4. IF system encounters edge cases THEN it SHALL escalate to human review with detailed context
5. WHEN processing batch transactions THEN the system SHALL prioritize and sequence analysis autonomously
6. WHEN system load is high THEN the agent SHALL optimize its processing strategy automatically

### Requirement 3: Advanced Integration and Tool Usage

**User Story:** As a fraud detection agent, I want to integrate with multiple external systems and tools, so that I can gather comprehensive data for accurate fraud analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing transactions THEN the system SHALL query external databases for user history
2. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL search for similar cases in fraud databases
3. WHEN location analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL use geolocation and risk assessment APIs
4. IF additional verification is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with identity verification services
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL compile data from multiple sources automatically
6. WHEN system needs updates THEN it SHALL fetch latest fraud patterns and rules from external sources

### Requirement 4: AWS Bedrock Agent Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the fraud detection system to fully utilize AWS Bedrock Agent capabilities, so that it meets AWS AI agent standards and can be deployed in enterprise environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL use AWS Bedrock Agent framework for orchestration
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL leverage Bedrock's agent capabilities for tool usage
3. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL use Bedrock's reasoning and planning features
4. IF external tools are needed THEN the system SHALL use Bedrock's function calling capabilities
5. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL utilize AWS infrastructure for high availability
6. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with AWS CloudWatch and X-Ray

### Requirement 5: Memory and Learning Capabilities

**User Story:** As a fraud detection system, I want to remember past decisions and learn from new patterns, so that I can improve accuracy over time and adapt to evolving fraud techniques.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing transactions THEN the system SHALL store decision context in memory
2. WHEN similar transactions occur THEN the system SHALL reference previous decisions and outcomes
3. WHEN patterns change THEN the system SHALL update its knowledge base automatically
4. IF feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL incorporate it into future decision-making
5. WHEN new fraud types emerge THEN the system SHALL learn and adapt its detection methods
6. WHEN performance metrics decline THEN the system SHALL analyze and adjust its approach

### Requirement 6: Multi-Agent Coordination

**User Story:** As a comprehensive fraud prevention platform, I want multiple specialized agents to work together, so that I can handle different aspects of fraud detection collaboratively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex analysis is needed THEN specialized agents SHALL collaborate on the decision
2. WHEN transaction volume is high THEN agents SHALL distribute workload efficiently
3. WHEN expertise is required THEN the system SHALL route cases to appropriate specialist agents
4. IF agents disagree THEN the system SHALL have a conflict resolution mechanism
5. WHEN new agent types are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing agents
6. WHEN coordination is needed THEN agents SHALL communicate through standardized protocols

### Requirement 7: Real-time Streaming and Event Processing

**User Story:** As a real-time fraud detection system, I want to process continuous transaction streams and respond to events immediately, so that I can prevent fraud as it happens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transaction streams arrive THEN the system SHALL process them in real-time
2. WHEN fraud events are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger immediate responses
3. WHEN system load varies THEN processing SHALL scale automatically to maintain performance
4. IF critical events occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize them over routine processing
5. WHEN event patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL detect and respond to them autonomously
6. WHEN downstream systems need updates THEN events SHALL be propagated in real-time

### Requirement 8: Explainable AI and Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want detailed explanations for all fraud detection decisions, so that I can audit the system and meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN decisions are made THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reasoning explanations
2. WHEN audits are conducted THEN complete decision trails SHALL be available
3. WHEN explanations are requested THEN they SHALL be in human-readable format
4. IF decisions are challenged THEN supporting evidence SHALL be retrievable
5. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate them automatically
6. WHEN decision logic changes THEN the audit trail SHALL reflect the evolution
